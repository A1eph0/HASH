# About

**H**rish's **A**rbitary **SH**ell (**HASH**) is a functional implementation of a shell for Linux based systems. Coded completely in C language, the shell replicates the basic functionality of other popular shells like Bash and Zsh. 

For instructions running the shell, click [here](#running-the-shell).

# Structuring of Code
- The code is written in **C language**.
- The code files are present in the the `src` directory.
- The driver of the shell is coded in the `hash.c` file.
- The utilities required in the internal function of the code are coded in `utils.c`.
- The functions implemented within the shell are present in `funcs.c`.
- Standard C libraries are called within `defns.h`. 
- Global macros are also defined within `defns.h`.

# Salient Features
- The shell is coded from scratch using **C language**.
- The shell has a **built-in parser** which processes the input, taking into account extra spaces and tabs, semi-colons, ampersand etc.
- Has a **colorised** prompt for better user experience.
- The prompt is of the form `<username@hostname:current_working_directory>`.
- `current_working_directory` is **relative to the execution location of the shell**, if it is below the execution location in the file tree. Otherwise, it shows the **absolute path** of the current working directory. 
- Built-in commands are implemented within the shell, which include:
  - `echo`
  - `ls`
  - `clear`
  - `cd`
  - `pwd`
  - `exit` / `quit`
  - `history`
  - `pinfo`
  - `repeat`
- Commands that are not builtin are executed using `execvp()` function.
- All commands accept paths in **relative to current working directory**, **relative to invocation location** (`~`) and **absolute** forms.

# Functionalities
In this section, we will explore the functionalities implemented in the shell in detail.

## Input and Parser
- `getline()` function is used to take raw input.
- Parser processses the input into a proccessed string, which consists of valid commands separated by the delimiter `;`.
- Each of these commands are tokenised using `strtok()` and sent ahead for execution.

## Execution and Dispatcher
- The command is tokenised and stored `char *command` and `char *args[]`, where `command` contains the command to be executed and `args[]` contain all the arguments.
- This is sent to the dispatcher, which dispatches it to corresponding built-in function.
- In case ths command is not built-in, it is dispatched to `void other_command(char *command, char *args[])`.
- From here, the command is sent to `void exec_back(char *args[])` or `void exec_fore(char *args[])` depending whether the last argument is `&` or not.

## `ls` Command
- In case multiple arguments are given, it prints the argument before printing the output corresponding to it 
- Both `-a` and `-l` flags have been implemented.
- For `-l` flag:
  - `total` is calculated by taking the sum of blocks given by `((file_stat.st_blocks * 512 + 1023) / 1024)` over all the files.
  - In case one of the file in output is a symbolic link, the curresponding real path is also displayed in the form `symbolic_link -> real_path`.
  - Time is of the format **MMM DD YYYY** if the timestamp is 6 months (15778476 seconds) old or is a future time, and **MMM DD HH:MM** format otherwise.

## `cd` Command
- `cd -` is implemented by storing previous location in global variable `PREV_LOC` everytime the directory is changed.

## `pinfo` Command
- Status and virtual memory are obtained from `/proc/<pid>/stat`.
- Executable path is obtained from link at `/proc/<pid>/exe`.

## `history`
- The history is stored in `~/.hash_history`.
- It is loaded before input is taken and rewritten once input is recieved.
- In case the current command is same as the last command in history, then the current command is not stored in history.

## Foreground Processes
- `pid` is generated by `fork()`.
- The commands are executed through `execvp()`.
- `waitpid()` is used to wait till termination.

## Background Processes
- Simalar to Foreground Processes except `waitpid()` is not used.
- `signal()` is used to watch for the exit signal sent by the process and print the corresponding exit message

# Running the Shell
Compile the shell from the parent directory and run the file as shown below:
```
$ make && ./hash
```
Alernatively you can run the precompiled executable provided in the repository:
```
$ ./hash
```
