Welcome to ***H**rish's **A**rbitary **SH**ell* (**HASH**), a functional implementation of a shell. Coded completely in C language, the shell replicates the basic functionality of other popular shells like Bash and Zsh.

Feel free to fork and tinker around with the code. In case you come across any bugs, feel free to reach out to me [here](mailto:hrishi.narayanan@research.iiit.ac.in).
